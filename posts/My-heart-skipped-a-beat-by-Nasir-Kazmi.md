# “My heart skipped a beat” by Nasir Kazmi

Thanks to Youtube's recommendation algorithm, I came across this beautiful [ghazal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghazal) written by poet [Nasir Kazmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasir_Kazmi). The soulful voice of [Shafqat Amanat Ali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shafqat_Amanat_Ali) takes this amazying piece of poetry to another level.

Dil dharakne ka sabab yaad aayaa\
Woh teri yaad thi ab yaad aayaa\
\
\
Haal-e-dil ham bhi sunate lekin\
Jab who rukhsat hue tab yaad aayaa\
\
\
Aaj mushkil tha sambhalna ae dost\
Tu museebat mein ajab yaad aayaa\
\
\
Baith kar saayaa-e-gul  mein 'Nasir'\
Ham bohat roye woh jab yaad aayaa\

**English translation**
\
My heart skipped a beat suddenly today,\
And I remembered you, my beloved! \
\
\
I wanted to express the state of my heart,\
But when that time came, you were not in my life.\
\
\
Keeping up appearances was not so easy in that moment\
My heart could think of only you, when I tried not to.\
\
\
Sitting in a shadow of tranquility today,\
I can think of only you and my heart bleeds.\
