# “My heart skipped a beat” by Nasir Kazmi

Thanks to YouTube's recommendation algorithm, I came across this beautiful [ghazal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghazal) written by poet [Nasir Kazmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasir_Kazmi). The soulful voice of [Shafqat Amanat Ali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shafqat_Amanat_Ali) takes this amazing piece of poetry to another level.

Dil dharakne ka sabab yaad aayaa\
Woh teri yaad thi ab yaad aayaa\
\
Haal-e-dil ham bhi sunate lekin\
Jab who rukhsat hue tab yaad aayaa\
\
Aaj mushkil tha sambhalna ae dost\
Tu museebat mein ajab yaad aayaa\
\
Baith kar saayaa-e-gul  mein 'Nasir'\
Ham bohat roye woh jab yaad aayaa\

**English translation**
\

\

The reason my heart began to beat, I now recall,\
It was your memory that came to visit, after all.\

\

My heart's tale I would have shared, but only then,\
When you departed, did it come to mind again.\

\

Today was tough, my friend, to keep my poise and stance,\
In troubled times, your memory came like a trance.\

\

Sitting in the shade of blooms, 'Nasir', as I do,\
I wept a lot when your memory into view.\
